"give_opinion(name[Ori and the Blind Forest], rating[excellent], genres[adventure, platformer, puzzle], player_perspective[side view])","Ori and the Blind Forest is a truly wonderful game.

"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], developer[Codemasters Southam], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])",I thought Dirt: Showdown was just ordinary. Codemasters Southam's choice of a first person perspective was not a smart one.

"give_opinion(name[Mirror's Edge Catalyst], developer[EA Digital Illusions CE], rating[average], genres[action-adventure, fighting])","EA Digital Illusions CE did an okay job on Mirror's Edge Catalyst, but the action-adventure fighting game didn't really live up to my hype for it."

"give_opinion(name[The Elder Scrolls Online], rating[average], player_perspective[first person], has_mac_release[yes])","The Elder Scrolls Online was not terribly bad, but that's just because I have a thing for first person games on Mac."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], esrb[T (for Teen)], rating[poor], genres[music])","I don't like music games, though I do at least like listening to music. However, the T rating of Guitar Hero: Smash Hits meant it couldn't include my favorite songs, and even that small joy was robbed from me."
"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Most Wanted], release_year[2005], rating[good], platforms[Xbox])","Need for Speed: Most Wanted was a strong release in 2005. It was basically the only reason I bought an Xbox originally, and I didn't regret that at all."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], rating[poor], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[PlayStation])","MotorStorm: Apocalypse was a pretty bad game, even the local multiplayer couldn't salvage the experience, despite my friends all joining me on my PlayStation."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat], player_perspective[third person])","MotorStorm: Apocalypse was really disappointing.

"give_opinion(name[Mirror's Edge Catalyst], developer[EA Digital Illusions CE], rating[average], genres[action-adventure, fighting])",EA Digital Illusions CE gets a solid C for this entry into the action-adventure fighting game genre. Mirror's Edge Catalyst is nothing special.
"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Shift], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, simulation], player_perspective[first person])","I think Need for Speed: Shift was an okay game, but it's not gonna be one of my favorites. It's just that first person driving/racing simulators are, for me, a type of game I always find to be merely okay."
"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], release_year[2005], rating[average], genres[pinball, puzzle])","Metroid Prime Pinball is just okay. I usually like games released in 2005, since that was a strong year, but I'm not really a big fan of puzzle pinball games."

"give_opinion(name[BioShock], rating[good], player_perspective[first person], platforms[PC])","I normally don't play games on the PC, but the first person perspective of BioShock was so well done that I actually thought the game was pretty good."
"give_opinion(name[Worms: Reloaded], rating[average], player_perspective[side view], available_on_steam[yes])",Worms: Reloaded is an average quality side view game you can at least find on Steam.
"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory], rating[good], genres[action, tactical], has_multiplayer[yes])",I'm pretty into Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. I've always been a fan of multiplayer tactical action games.
"give_opinion(name[StarCraft], developer[Blizzard Entertainment], rating[good], player_perspective[bird view])",StarCraft is an entertaining game released by Blizzard Entertainment. The bird's eye view in the game helps you keep an eye on everything in the game.
"give_opinion(name[Undertale], rating[excellent], player_perspective[bird view])",I loved Undertale. It really took advantage of the bird's eye view and did a lot of novel things in its genre.
"give_opinion(name[Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines], rating[good], genres[strategy, tactical], player_perspective[bird view])","Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is a pretty good game. The tactical strategy gameplay is fun, and the bird view perspective makes it easy to play."

"give_opinion(name[Diablo II], developer[Blizzard North], rating[good], has_mac_release[yes])","Oh man, I miss the old Blizzard North, Diablo II is a game that in many respects hasn't been rivaled. And thankfully, it's out on Mac too!"
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], rating[average], player_perspective[first person], platforms[PlayStation])","Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was just plain average. I like games that are on the PlayStation normally, but the first person perspective made the experience kind of mediocre."
"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's The Division], release_year[2016], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes])","Tom Clancy's The Division is an all-around average multiplayer game from 2016, I would say."

"give_opinion(name[RollerCoaster Tycoon], rating[good], genres[simulation, strategy], has_mac_release[no])","RollerCoaster Tycoon is a pretty good single-player strategy simulation game. My only tiny gripe with it is that it doesn't run on Mac, so I have to sit at my desktop computer to play it."
"give_opinion(name[Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne], rating[poor], genres[role-playing, turn-based strategy])",I didn't enjoy Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne. I just can't seem to get into turn-based strategy games that also include role-playing elements.
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], rating[average], genres[action, shooter], has_multiplayer[yes])","When it comes to multiplayer action shooters, I do tend to be quite picky.

"give_opinion(name[Mirror's Edge Catalyst], rating[average], player_perspective[first person], platforms[PlayStation])","Mirror's Edge Catalyst was a pretty mediocre first person game. When it came to the PlayStation, I picked it up, but honestly I found it didn't do the premise justice."
"give_opinion(name[Rocket League], developer[Psyonix], esrb[E (for Everyone)], rating[good])","I like playing E rated games, but it seems so many developers don't put effort into them. Fortunately, Psyonix is a developer that does, so I had a good time playing Rocket League."

"give_opinion(name[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim], release_year[2011], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[good])","I know The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an M rated game from 2011, but it's my favorite game from that year."
"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], developer[Nintendo EAD], rating[excellent], player_perspective[side view])","Man, Super Mario World is great, such a classic! It really set the stage for future side view games too, truly a masterclass in design from Nintendo EAD."
